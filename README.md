Analysis of the housing rental market data for San Francisco. 

This challenge involves using my learning in data visualisation, aggregation, interactive visualisations, and geospatial analysis, to apply in analysing the given properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

To be able to achieve this, I had to import then wrangle raw data from the supplied csv files. I use the san_francisco_housing.ipynb notebook to visualise and analyse the real-estate data. Additionally, I need to read the sfo_neighborhoods_census_data.csv file from the Resources folder into the notebook and create the DataFrame that Iâ€™ll use in the analysis.

The main task in this Challenge is to visualise and analyse the real-estate data in Jupyter notebook.
